## Big O

|         Algorithm         |      Performance       |
|:-------------------------:|:----------------------:|
|       Linear Search       |          O(n)          |
|       Binary Search       |        O(log n)        |
|        Jump Search        |         O(âˆšn)          |
|    Exponential Search     |        O(log n)        |
|   Naive Pattern Search    |        O(m * n)        |
|     Rabin-Karp Search     |        O(m * n)        |
| Knuth-Morris-Prath Search | O(m) + O(k) = O(n + k) |

## NOTE

- There are tons of examples that use efficient search algorithms to run their business. 
- Search engines such as Google and Bing are some examples. 
- Also, database queries which sends us results so fast by applying some advanced search techniques. 
- Search algorithms work best if the items are already sorted.

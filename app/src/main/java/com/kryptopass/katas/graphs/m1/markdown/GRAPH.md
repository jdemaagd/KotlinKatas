# Graphs Foundation

## Plan

- Eulerian cycle or path problem
- Graph representations
- General graph traversal

## Graph Traversal

- BFS
    - bipartite
    - connected components & cycles
- Dijkstra
    - Bellman-Ford
- Prim
- DFS
    - connected components & cycles
    - top.sort
        - SCC
    - Bridges & articulation points
- Best-first
    - A^*

## Tackling Graph Steps

- Step 1: Could the problem be modeled as a graph problem?
- Step 2: Would a simple graph traversal help solve the problem?
- Step 3: Would some popular standard extension of it help solve the problem?
- Step 4: Code it up!

# Eulerian Cycle

## Constructing Eulerian Cycles

- If a graph is connected, and the degree of every vertex is even, does it have an Eulerian cycle?
- Eulerian cycle -> Every vertex has even degree
- Is the converse, true?
- A -> B <==> B -> A ??
- Square -> Rectangle -> true
- Rectangle -> Square -> false
- Yes -> if every vertex has even degree, then a connected graph has an Eulerian cycle
- So the converse is true

## What about Eulerian Paths?

- Can be an Eulerian cycle
- OR start and end at different vertices
- Start and end vertices are the only vertices with odd degree

## Königsberg Poem

```
Some citizens of Königsberg
Were walking on the strand
Beside the river Pregel
With its seven bridges spanned.

"O Euler, come and walk with us",
Those burghers did beseech.
"We'll roam the seven bridges o'er,
And pass but once by each."

"It can't be done", thus Euler cried.
"Here comes the Q.E.D.
Your islands are but vertices,
And four have odd degree."

From Königsberg to König's book,
So runs the graphic tale,
And still it grows more colorful,
In Michigan and Yale.
```

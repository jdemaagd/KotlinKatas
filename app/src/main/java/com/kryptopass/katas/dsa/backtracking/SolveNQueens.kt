/*
n-queens puzzle is problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other
Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
You may return the answer in any order.
Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

Example 1
Input: n = 4
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above

Example 2
Input: n = 1
Output: [["Q"]]

Constraints:
    1 <= n <= 9

Observations:
0. filling row by row
1. only one queen per row
2. check col up to current row (cols above row)
3. check top-left diagonal
4. check top-right diagonal

Time Complexity Analysis -> ùëÇ(ùëõ!)
    row 1 -> n
    row 2 -> n - 2
    row 3 -> n - 4
    upper bound can be taken as n!
    notice that it's not n^n because of pruning
    we're not filling queens in all the positions in all the rows
    whenever we encounter a scenario that is not valid, we prune that branch
Space Complexity Analysis -> ùëÇ(ùëõ^2)
    as we build solutions we have to hold state of board (n x n)
    we know that every row will have only 1 queen
    so recursive call stack will take the order of n
    we take the dominant term which is n^2 over n
NOTE: space used just to return output is not counted as auxiliary space and not counted in space complexity
